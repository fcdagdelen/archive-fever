# Latent Digest

Deep research essays on the intersection of **AI systems**, **cognitive architectures**, and **human-machine interfaces**.

These are time-clustered explorations—snapshots of intellectual preoccupations that don't seek coherence but sometimes find it anyway. The "latent" refers to what lies beneath the surface: hidden structures in language, cognition, and technical systems that these essays attempt to surface.
