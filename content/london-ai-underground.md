# London's philosophical AI underground: A field guide

London's speculative and philosophically-inclined AI scene operates as a loose confederacy of art school graduates, continental philosophers, AI safety heterodox thinkers, and speculative designers—fundamentally distinct from San Francisco's startup culture or Berlin's hacker collectives. The scene's intellectual DNA traces directly to the Royal College of Art's Design Interactions program (2005-2015) under Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, whose "speculative design" methodology treated technology as cultural material for interrogation rather than commercial deployment. Today, this community clusters around a handful of institutional anchors—Serpentine Galleries, King's Digital Humanities, Goldsmiths Computational Arts—while coordinating through meetups, reading groups, and Telegram channels scattered across zones 1-3.

## The people actually doing interesting work

The most intellectually serious figure bridging AI and philosophy is **Joanna Zylinska**, Professor of Media Philosophy at King's College London. Her 2023 book *The Perception Machine* (MIT Press) develops an eco-feminist framework for machine vision, while her concept of "feminist counter-apocalypse" offers alternatives to both tech-utopian and doomer narratives. She's a core member of the **Creative AI Lab**, the research collaboration between King's and Serpentine that produces the most substantive theoretical work on AI art in London.

**Mercedes Bunz**, Senior Lecturer in Digital Society at King's and Principal Investigator of Creative AI Lab, focuses on how machine learning transforms knowledge production and aesthetic experience. Her work represents the continental philosophy approach—drawing on STS and posthumanism rather than analytical philosophy.

The artist community centers on practitioners like **Anna Ridler**, whose "handmade datasets" (photographing 10,000 tulips for her Myriad series) expose the human labor obscured by ML abstractions. **Lawrence Lek** builds Sinofuturist cinematic universes exploring AI consciousness. **Luba Elliott** functions as the scene's primary community builder, running Creative AI meetups since 2016 and curating at Serpentine, NeurIPS, and the V&A.

On the AI safety philosophy side, **Conjecture** (founded by Connor Leahy, based near London Bridge) takes a heterodox approach to alignment research. The **London Initiative for Safe AI (LISA)** in Shoreditch houses Apollo Research, Leap Labs, and MATS extension programs—more technically focused but with philosophical currents. The **London AI and Humanity Project** at the Institute of Philosophy, University of London runs the most academically rigorous programming, including an annual Philosophy of AI Summer School and "Summer of AI Fellowships."

## Where the scene actually convenes

**Regular meetups with philosophical orientation:**

The **Creative AI Meetup** (Luba Elliott's operation, now on Lu.ma) has run monthly since 2016, featuring artists and researchers presenting at venues including IDEALondon. This is the primary coordination point for the AI-art crowd. **Speculative Futures: London** (part of the global SF-founded network) meets several times yearly at various venues for design futures discussions—search meetup.com/Speculative-Futures-London. The **School of Critical Design** offers membership-based talks and courses on speculative design, AI implications, and post-capitalist futures, with speakers like Amber Case (Mozilla Fellow, *Calm Technology* author).

The **London LessWrong/Rationalist Meetups** happen fortnightly (every other Sunday, 2pm) at **Shakespeare's Head pub** (WC2B 6BG)—look for the Art Lebedev paperclip sign. This crowd overlaps with AI safety and Effective Altruism communities; more analytically-minded than the design/arts scene but active on existential risk questions.

**Conway Hall** (Red Lion Square) hosts the London Philosophy Club—the world's largest—which occasionally programs AI-related talks amid broader philosophical discussions.

**Key venues for events:**

**Serpentine Galleries** declared 2024 their "Year of AI" and represents the primary institutional hub. Their Arts Technologies department (est. 2014, led by Kay Watson) commissions major works—Refik Anadol's "Echoes of the Earth" (Feb-April 2024), Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst's "The Call" (Oct 2024-Feb 2025). The Serpentine's **Future Art Ecosystems** reports function as scene-defining documents; FAE4 "Art x Public AI" (2024) is essential reading.

**Somerset House Studios** houses **70 resident artists** working with technology, offering 1-7 year residencies and programming including the **Creative Technologies Fellowship** (with UAL's Creative Computing Institute) and a new **UNESCO AI Ethics Residency** launching 2025/2026. Their **n-Space** initiative explicitly focuses on art-technology experimentation.

**Science Gallery London** (at King's, London Bridge) ran "AI: Who's Looking After Me?" throughout 2023-2024, exploring AI ethics through artistic commissions. The **ICA** maintains historical significance—the original 1968 "Cybernetic Serendipity" exhibition was foundational—and hosted the 2024 "Cybernetic Serendipity: Towards AI" symposium featuring Mercedes Bunz, William Latham, and Lawrence Lek.

**Hackerspaces:** **London Hackspace** (now in Wembley) holds Wednesday open nights from 7pm; includes the London Biohackspace in its basement. More maker-focused than philosophically-oriented, but attracts some of this crowd.

## Academic programs that matter

For someone approaching AI from continental philosophy, psychoanalysis, or speculative architecture, the relevant programs cluster around a few institutions:

**King's College London** launched the UK's first **BSc Artificial Intelligence & Philosophy** (2024/2025), combining technical AI education with philosophy of mind and ethics. Their Department of Digital Humanities (one of the oldest globally, since 1992) houses the Creative AI Lab and employs key thinkers including Kate Devlin (Reader in AI & Society).

**Goldsmiths' MA/MFA Computational Arts** is the primary destination for artists working with computation. The program includes modules on "Critical AI" and "Data and Machine Learning for Artistic Practice"—explicitly engaging socio-political effects of technology. The 2024 degree show featured 90+ computational artists at Union Chapel. No prior coding required; portfolio-based admission.

**Royal College of Art's MA Information Experience Design** represents the successor to Dunne & Raby's Design Interactions. The program works with "post-humanities, philosophy, ecology, critical theory, speculative design, emergent technologies" to create "experiences of complexity that communicate human, nonhuman, and more-than-human perspectives." J. Paul Neeley teaches speculative design here and leads the School of Critical Design.

**UCL** launches a new **MASc Philosophy, Logic, and Artificial Intelligence** for September 2026 entry. The **Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence** (Cambridge-based but with Imperial College London spoke) offers an **MPhil in Ethics of AI, Data and Algorithms**—the most rigorous academic credential in this space.

For policy-oriented approaches, **LSE's Data Science Institute** runs year-long programming on "AI, technology and society," while the **Ada Lovelace Institute** (independent, Nuffield Foundation-funded) produces the most substantive UK research on AI ethics and governance.

## What makes London's scene culturally distinct

London's philosophical AI community differs fundamentally from San Francisco and Berlin in ways that matter for finding your people:

**Against SF techno-optimism:** Where San Francisco's scene is VC-driven, engineering-focused, and oriented toward "building"—with ethics largely confined to safety labs like Anthropic—London maintains a more skeptical, critical posture. British intellectual culture's tendency toward irony and critique produces different conversations. The RCA Design Interactions legacy means practitioners here are more likely to ask "what are the implications?" than "how do we scale?"

**More institutionally anchored than Berlin:** Berlin's scene operates through artist-hacker collectives and DIY spaces with anti-capitalist positioning. London has heavier institutional infrastructure—universities, museums, policy organizations—which creates more formal pathways but also more established critical discourse.

**Continental philosophy rather than analytical:** The theoretical orientation draws on Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, Rosi Braidotti, and Science and Technology Studies rather than the analytical philosophy tradition dominant in AI ethics at Oxford. Anab Jain's concept of "more-than-human design" (coined at IXDA 2018) signals this posthumanist orientation.

**Productive tension with mainstream tech:** The boundaries between tech, art, and academia are notably porous. **Superflux** (Anab Jain and Jon Ardern's studio) consults for Google AI and DeepMind while exhibiting at MoMA and Venice Biennale. DeepMind employs philosophers and funds academic positions. This creates less separation than in other cities—the critical crowd and the building crowd actually talk.

The scene operates as **overlapping circles** rather than a unified community: speculative designers (RCA-adjacent), AI artists (Goldsmiths/Serpentine orbit), AI safety philosophers (LISA/EA-adjacent), and academic digital humanities (King's/UCL). Someone interested in psychoanalysis and AI would find more resonance in the King's Digital Humanities crowd; someone from mechanism design might connect better through the LISA/rationalist meetups; speculative architecture types should look to RCA alumni networks.

## Online coordination points

**Essential newsletters:** Luba Elliott's **Creative AI newsletter** (elluba.com) tracks the art-AI intersection. Nathan Benaich's **State of AI Report** (stateof.ai) provides the most comprehensive annual analysis, though oriented toward tech rather than philosophy. **The EU AI Act Newsletter** (Risto Uuk) covers regulatory developments. Graham Lovelace's **Charting Gen AI** addresses creators' rights and ethics.

**Podcasts:** **Thinking Machines: AI & Philosophy** (Daniel Reid Cahn, King's College London alum) directly addresses the AI-philosophy intersection. **London Futurists** (David Wood, Calum Chace) covers singularity and transhumanist perspectives. The **Oxford Ethics in AI podcast** (podcasts.ox.ac.uk) archives academic lectures.

**Telegram/Discord:** Serpentine Arts Technologies maintains a Telegram community and hosts monthly community calls. The rationalist scene coordinates through LessWrong London (lesswrong.com/groups/L2rpiNbg7YcAnqD3S). Discord servers tend toward technical ML rather than philosophical discussion.

**Twitter/X accounts worth following:** @superflux_in (Superflux studio), @anab_jain (Anab Jain), @jpaulus (J. Paul Neeley), @shanahan_murray (Murray Shanahan, Imperial/DeepMind philosopher of mind), @rachelcoldicutt (Rachel Coldicutt, formerly Doteveryone).

## Entry points for different interests

**Continental philosophy + AI:** Start with Joanna Zylinska's work and King's Digital Humanities programming. Attend Creative AI Lab events and read Future Art Ecosystems reports.

**Psychoanalysis + technology:** The scene is thinner here—look to academic programming at Birkbeck or independent reading groups that occasionally surface through the London Philosophy Club.

**Mechanism design + AI:** Connect through LISA in Shoreditch, EA London meetups, and the rationalist crowd at Shakespeare's Head. The Institute of Philosophy's London AI and Humanity Project bridges academic rigor with these concerns.

**Speculative architecture:** RCA Information Experience Design is the natural home. Follow Superflux's work and attend School of Critical Design events. Speculative Futures London meetups draw this crowd.

**AI art practice:** Goldsmiths Computational Arts for formal study; Creative AI meetups and Serpentine programming for community. Apply for Somerset House Studios residencies.

The scene is alive and intellectually serious, but dispersed—requiring active navigation rather than showing up to a single obvious place. The Creative AI meetup and Serpentine programming represent the closest things to focal points, while the academic programs at King's, Goldsmiths, and RCA provide deeper intellectual engagement.
